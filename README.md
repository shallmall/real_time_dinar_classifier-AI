# real_time_dinar_classifier-AI Real-Time Tunisian Currency Recognition with Deep Learning ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡³ðŸ’µ

a real-time image classification system that uses a webcam and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect and classify Tunisian Dinar banknotes. The system leverages computer vision (OpenCV) and AI (TensorFlow/Keras) to provide fast, live predictions of currency denominations.
